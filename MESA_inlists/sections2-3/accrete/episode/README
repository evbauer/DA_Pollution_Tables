Use MESA version 10398.

These inlists will reproduce figure 3. Run inlist_accrete until it
reaches its stopping condition. Then switch to inlist_stop_accrete and
restart from the last photo.

To instead reproduce figure 2, simply edit inlist_accrete so that the
species shown there are each accreting with mass fraction 0.1.
