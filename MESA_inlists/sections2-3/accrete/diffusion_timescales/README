Use MESA version 10398.
Also requires the ruby tool MesaScript, available at https://github.com/wmwolf/MesaScript

The script loads in the models that you can produce in
../../make_more_models, and calculates diffusion timescales, which are
recorded in the history output by routines that you can find in
run_star_extras.f.

You need to specify which element you want to accrete and track for
recording diffusion timescales in the places where you find "ISO_HERE"
in accrete.rb and run_star_extras.f.

Put these files in a MESA work directory, and execture the script by
running "ruby accrete.rb"

This will repeatedly overwrite inlist_accrete with updated parameters
for a range of Teff, then call the rn script and save to a new LOGS
directory.
