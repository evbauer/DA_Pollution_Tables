Use MESA version 10398.
Also requires the ruby tool MesaScript, available at https://github.com/wmwolf/MesaScript

This script produces many WD mods along a cooling sequence so that
a specified Teff can easily be loaded in for accreting models.

To run it, simply make a default MESA work directory, copy in the
appropriate starting model (e.g. ../DA_0.6.mod) and then execute "ruby coolDA.rb"
