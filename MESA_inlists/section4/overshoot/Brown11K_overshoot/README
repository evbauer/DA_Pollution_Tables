Use MESA version 11191.
Also requires the ruby tool MesaScript, available at https://github.com/wmwolf/MesaScript

This should be a working MESA work directory. Just compile, and then
execute the srcipt by running "ruby thermo.rb"

This will reproduce the mass fractions shown by the green line in
figure 10.
