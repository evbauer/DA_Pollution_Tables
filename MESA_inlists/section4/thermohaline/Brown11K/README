Use MESA version 11191.
Also requires the ruby tool MesaScript, available at https://github.com/wmwolf/MesaScript

The script loads in the models that you can produce in
../../../sections2-3/make_more_models/. These models then accrete bulk
earth composition for 100 diffusion timescales with both diffusion and
thermohaline mixing occuring in the model.

This should be a working MESA work directory. Just compile, and then
execute the srcipt by running "ruby thermo.rb".

This will reproduce the mass fractions shown by the orange line in
figure 5. If you want to produce the other lines in that figure, use
the same setup, but change the thermohaline_option to 'Kippenhahn' in
thermo.rb, and adjust thermohaline_coeff as well.
