The MESA work directory Brown11K shows an example for scripting MESA
runs for a range of accretion rates on a Teff = 11000K model.

To script a similar sequence for a different Teff, change these
parameters at the beginning of thermo.rb: logtaudiff and
log_surf_cvz_dq. These should be set to values from Table 2 in the
paper (which can also be found in ../../../diffusion_timescales).

Also, change the assignment of "loadsave" to point to a DA WD model of
the desired effective temperature.
